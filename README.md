## Key Features

### Adoption Progress Tracking
- The system includes a feature to track the progress of each adoption application. This allows staff to monitor the status of applications, from submission to approval or denial. A status history for each application can be viewed, showing the stages it has gone through.

### Waiting List
- A waiting list feature is implemented for situations where multiple adopters are interested in the same dog. If a dog has pending adoption applications, the system places other interested adopters on a waiting list. They are notified if the initial adoption falls through, allowing for a smoother transition of ownership.

### Volunteer Management: 
- The system allows the management of volunteers who are willing to help the shelter in various capacities, including:
  - **Food Management**: Volunteers can sign up to provide food for the dogs to ensure consistent and appropriate care.
  - **Walking and Exercise**: Volunteers can manage dog walking and exercise routines to keep the dogs active and healthy.
  - **Cleaning and Maintenance**: Volunteers can sign up for cleaning shifts to ensure the shelter's cleanliness and hygiene.

### Temporary Adoption
Temporary adoption functionality is included for cases where adopters may only be able to provide temporary care to a dog. The system allows for the creation of temporary adoption records, specifying the duration of the temporary arrangement.

### Staff Features
Staff members can log in to manage dog records, review adoption applications and send email notifications.
- Admin Panel: Create an admin panel for staff to manage dog records, applications and approvals efficiently.
- Adoption Listings: Allow staff to add new dogs to the database and set their adoption status. Dogs available for adoption are visible to prospective adopters.
- Approval Process: Enable staff members to review adoption applications, contact adopters and approve or deny adoptions. Update the dog's status to "Adopted" upon approval.

### Prospective Adopters Features
Prospective adopters can create accounts, search for dogs, submit adoption applications and receive notifications about their applications.
- Search and Filter: Provide a search and filter functionality for adopters to find dogs based on criteria like breed, age and gender.
- Adoption Application: Enable adopters to complete adoption applications, including contact information and reasons for wanting to adopt a specific dog.

## What's Included
- Dog Database: Maintain a comprehensive database of dogs available for adoption, including details such as name, breed, size, age, gender and photos.
- User Authentication: Implement user authentication with distinct roles for staff and adopters to ensure secure access to features.
- Email Notifications: Send email notifications to adopters when their applications are approved or denied.
- Data Validation: Implement input validation and error handling to maintain data integrity and security.
