# Dog Adoption Management System
## Project Description
The Dog Adoption Management System is a Java application designed for a dog adoption center. This application allows shelter staff to manage dog records, enables prospective adopters to search for dogs and facilitates the dog adoption process.

## Usage
- Staff members can log in to manage dog records, review adoption applications and send email notifications.
- Prospective adopters can create accounts, search for dogs, submit adoption applications and receive notifications about their applications.

## Key Features
- Dog Database: Maintain a comprehensive database of dogs available for adoption, including details such as name, breed, age, weight, temperament and photos.

- User Authentication: Implement user authentication with distinct roles for staff and adopters to ensure secure access to features.

- Adoption Listings: Allow staff to add new dogs to the database and set their adoption status. Dogs available for adoption are visible to prospective adopters.

- Search and Filter: Provide a search and filter functionality for adopters to find dogs based on criteria like breed, age and temperament.

- Adoption Application: Enable adopters to complete adoption applications, including contact information and reasons for wanting to adopt a specific dog.

- Approval Process: Enable staff members to review adoption applications, contact adopters and approve or deny adoptions. Update the dog's status to "Adopted" upon approval.

- Admin Panel: Create an admin panel for staff to manage dog records, applications and approvals efficiently.

- Email Notifications: Send automated email notifications to adopters when their applications are approved or denied.

- Image Upload: Allow staff to upload dog photos and ensure that adopters can view these images when browsing dog listings.

- Data Validation: Implement input validation and error handling to maintain data integrity and security.
